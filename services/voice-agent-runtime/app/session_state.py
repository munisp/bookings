"""Per-conversation session state + the phone-confirmation policy (SPEC §11).

Policy: mutating tools (book/lookup/reschedule/cancel) refuse to run without a
*confirmed* contact phone in session state. Confirmation is two-step and
server-enforced (never delegated to the model):

1. First mutating call carrying a phone number -> the phone becomes
   `pending_phone` and the tool returns `confirmation_required` so the agent
   reads the number back to the caller.
2. A subsequent mutating call with the *same* phone confirms it (the model
   re-issues the call after the caller said "yes"); the phone becomes
   `confirmed_phone` and the call proceeds.

State is in-memory (dev-grade; swap `SessionStore` for the Dapr state store
`statestore.redis` in production — the interface is tiny).
