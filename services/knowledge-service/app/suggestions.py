"""Self-improving knowledge base (SPEC-W3 §4, innovation 4).

When hybrid search can't answer a question (top RRF score below
``SUGGEST_THRESHOLD``, default 0.35) and the query looks like a question,
the service records a ``kb_suggestions`` row (deduped per tenant+question).
Staff review the queue via GET /v1/suggestions and either approve (the
question becomes a real ingested document) or reject it.

This module holds the pure logic + SQL so it is unit-testable without
OpenSearch/embeddings; the HTTP wiring lives in app/main.py.
