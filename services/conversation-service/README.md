# conversation-service

Conversation session + turn persistence and transcript streaming for OpenDesk
(SPEC §4 topics, §7 conversation schema, §11 voice pipeline). Python 3.12,
FastAPI, asyncpg, structlog.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/healthz` | Liveness (pings Postgres) |
| POST | `/v1/conversations` | Start a conversation `{tenant_id, site_slug, channel}` (channel: voice\|chat\|phone\|api) |
| POST | `/v1/conversations/{id}/turns` | Append a turn `{role, text, tool_calls?, audio_url?}` (role: user\|agent\|system\|tool); seq assigned atomically |
| GET | `/v1/conversations?tenant=<uuid>` | List tenant conversations (paged) |
| GET | `/v1/conversations/{id}?tenant=<uuid>` | Conversation with all turns |

**Tenant scope** is required on every request via `?tenant=<uuid>` or the
`X-Tenant-ID` header. The schema enforces `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`
(`app.tenant_id` setting), so the service sets it per transaction — requests
without tenant scope are rejected `400`; cross-tenant rows are invisible.

## Turn pipeline (per accepted turn)

1. Insert into Postgres (`turns`, next `seq`, in a transaction with an
   advisory lock per conversation).
2. Publish the **raw record** `{conversationId, tenantId, role, text, ts}` to
   topic `opendesk.transcripts-raw` through a `TranscriptSink` (SPEC §5):
   - `TRANSCRIPT_SINK=fluvio` → `FluvioSink` (official fluvio python client,
     import guarded, sync client wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread`)
   - `TRANSCRIPT_SINK=kafka` (default) → `KafkaSink` (aiokafka producer,
     same topic name on Kafka) — also the automatic fallback when the
     optional `fluvio` package is missing.
3. Always publish a **CloudEvent** (`ConversationTurn` per SPEC §4) to Kafka
   topic `opendesk.conversation.transcripts` via the Dapr HTTP pubsub
   component `pubsub-kafka` (`application/cloudevents+json`).

Postgres is the source of truth: streaming/publish failures are logged and do
not fail the API request.

## Indexer

Background task (aiokafka consumer, group `conversation-service-indexer`)
reading `opendesk.conversation.transcripts` and bulk-indexing documents into
the OpenSearch index `conversations`, conforming to the mapping in
`infra/opensearch/setup-indices.sh` (`tenant_id, conversation_id, site_slug,
channel, role, text, audio_url, ts`). `site_slug`/`channel` are enriched from
Postgres; `redacted` is set by the index's `pii-safe` default ingest pipeline.
Batched flushes (size/time), explicit offset commits after each flush.

## Run

```bash
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .            # add [fluvio] for the Fluvio sink
python -m app.main
# or
docker build -t opendesk/conversation-service .
```

## Notes

- The fluvio dependency is optional (`pip install -e .[fluvio]`); the import
  is guarded so the image runs without it (default `kafka` sink).
- The Dockerfile builds with `pip install .` (core deps only); install the
  `fluvio` extra in a custom image when `TRANSCRIPT_SINK=fluvio`.

## Call-quality sentiment enrichment (Wave 5 #2)

Background task (`app/quality.py`, direct aiokafka like the indexer,
consumer group `conversation-sentiment`) consuming
`com.opendesk.conversation.SessionEnded` from
`opendesk.conversation.events`. When the event carries a `quality` payload
**and** `quality.confirmed_phone`, it averages the per-turn `sentiment`
scores of that conversation (turns table, written by app/intel.py) and
republishes the payload as `com.opendesk.conversation.CallQualityEnriched`
on the dedicated topic **`opendesk.conversation.quality`** — a separate
topic on purpose, so the enriched event can never retrigger SessionEnded
consumers. The enriched data adds `avg_sentiment` + `turn_sentiment_count`
(and sets `quality.avg_sentiment`). Skips (acked, never retried): no
quality, no confirmed phone, malformed ids, and conversations with zero
sentiment-scored turns. crm-sync-service merges this into the Twenty call
summary note (see its README for the eventual-consistency design).

## GDPR contact marker + privacy erasure (SPEC-W3 §2, innovation 13)

- `conversations.contact_phone` (nullable, idempotent
  `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` at startup + index) marks the
  data subject behind a conversation. It is populated at creation time from
  the caller's site/session metadata (`POST /v1/conversations` with
  `contact_phone`) when the visitor's phone (or e-mail) is known — anonymous
  sessions stay NULL. It is deliberately a single flat marker column instead
  of scanning turn text (PII minimization + cheap indexed lookups).
- `GET /v1/conversations?tenant=<uuid>&contact=<phone|email>` filters on
  this marker (used by `GdprExportWorkflow`).
- The privacy erase consumer (`app/privacy.py`, direct aiokafka like the
  indexer) consumes `PrivacyEraseRequested` tombstones from
  `opendesk.privacy.events` and deletes all turns of matching conversations,
  then clears the marker; conversation shells are kept for referential
  integrity. Env: `PRIVACY_ENABLED` (default true), `PRIVACY_EVENTS_TOPIC`,
  `PRIVACY_EVENTS_GROUP`.

## Data retention (NDPA 2023 / GDPR storage limitation)

`app/retention.py` runs a background sweeper (startup + hourly) that
**hard-deletes turns older than `RETENTION_DAYS`** (default 365; the NDPA
profile in `infra/privacy/ndpa-profile.env` sets 180 — see
docs/compliance/ndpa.md):

- Per-tenant batches: tenants are enumerated from the conversations table
  and each delete runs inside a tenant-scoped transaction
  (`app.tenant_id` set), so FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY confines every batch to
  its tenant. Enumeration requires a role that bypasses RLS — with the
  default `opendesk` superuser DSN this works out of the box; under an
  RLS-enforced role (`app_conversation_login`) the sweep finds no tenants
  and no-ops, so run retention with the superuser DSN or a maintenance role.
- The age cutoff is computed with the **database clock** (`now()` in SQL),
  so app-side clock skew can never extend the retention window.
- Deletes are batched (`RETENTION_BATCH_SIZE` per statement) to bound lock
  time; one tenant's failure is logged and does not stop the others.
- Orthogonal to GDPR/NDPA erasure: the privacy erase consumer deletes a data
  subject's turns immediately; the sweeper only removes aged rows erasure
  did not cover. Conversation shells are kept (referential integrity); only
  turn content is deleted. Indexed copies in OpenSearch are NOT covered —
  see docs/compliance/ndpa.md for the indexer caveat.
