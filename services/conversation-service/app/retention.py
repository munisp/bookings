"""Data-retention enforcement (NDPA 2023 — docs/compliance/ndpa.md).

The Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023 (like GDPR's storage-limitation
principle) requires personal data to be kept no longer than necessary.
This background sweeper hard-deletes conversation turns older than
``RETENTION_DAYS`` (default 365; the NDPA profile in
infra/privacy/ndpa-profile.env sets 180), running once at startup and then
every ``RETENTION_SWEEP_SECONDS`` (default hourly).

Design notes:

- Per-tenant batches: the sweep enumerates tenant ids and deletes inside a
  tenant-scoped transaction (``app.tenant_id`` set), so FORCE ROW LEVEL
  SECURITY keeps each batch inside its tenant. Enumeration requires a role
  that bypasses RLS (the default opendesk superuser DSN); under an
  RLS-enforced role the sweep finds no tenants and no-ops (documented in
  README — run it with the superuser DSN or a maintenance role).
- Cutoff uses the DATABASE clock (``now()`` in SQL), not the app clock, so
  app-side clock skew can never extend the retention window.
- Orthogonal to GDPR/NDPA erasure: the privacy erase consumer deletes a data
  subject's turns immediately; the sweeper only removes aged rows that
  erasure did not cover. Both hard-delete — no tombstones are resurrected.
- Conversation shells are kept (booking history/analytics referential
  integrity); only turn content is deleted. OpenSearch holds indexed
  transcripts — see docs/compliance/ndpa.md for the indexer caveat.
