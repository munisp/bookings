# payments-service

OpenDesk payments service (SPEC §9). Ledger-centric: all money movement is
double-entry against a TigerBeetle-compatible `LedgerClient` trait
(ADR-0007 fallback: default build ships an in-memory sim ledger).

- Port: **7004** (SPEC §3). Dapr sidecar expected at `daprd-payments:3500`.
- Stack: Rust 2021, axum 0.7, tokio, reqwest (no sqlx — payments is ledger-centric).

## Ledger model (SPEC §9)

Accounts per tenant: `tenant:{id}:deposits`, `tenant:{id}:revenue`; platform
accounts: `platform:fees`, `platform:clearing`, `platform:payouts`.
Amounts are minor units (cents). All transfers are idempotent by transfer id.

| Code | Meaning | Flow |
|---|---|---|
| 100 | deposit hold (pending) | `platform:clearing → tenant:{id}:deposits` (pending) |
| 101 | capture | posts hold, splits `deposits → revenue` (net) + `deposits → platform:fees` (fee) |
| 102 | refund | voids pending hold, or `revenue → platform:clearing` after capture |
| 103 | no-show fee | like capture, charges `amount_cents` of the hold, releases remainder |
| 104 | payout | `tenant:{id}:revenue → platform:payouts` (Mojaloop rail) |

`LEDGER_IMPL=sim` (default) uses the in-memory double-entry ledger
(`src/ledger/sim.rs`) with TigerBeetle semantics (pending/posted/voided,
idempotent ids, `debits_must_not_exceed_credits` on liability accounts).
`LEDGER_IMPL=tigerbeetle` requires building with `--features tb-live`
(see `src/ledger/tigerbeetle.rs`; ADR-0007).

## REST API

| Method | Path | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/healthz` | — | liveness |
| POST | `/v1/deposits` | `{tenant_id, booking_id?, amount_cents, currency?, idempotency_key?}` | hold (code 100) |
| POST | `/v1/deposits/{id}/capture` | `{tenant_id, amount_cents?}` | capture (101), full when amount omitted |
| POST | `/v1/refunds` | `{tenant_id, deposit_id?, amount_cents, reason?, idempotency_key?}` | void pending hold or post-capture refund (102) |
| POST | `/v1/no-show-fee` | `{tenant_id, deposit_id, amount_cents, booking_id?}` | charge fee from hold (103) |
| GET | `/v1/accounts/{tenant_id}/balance` | — | account snapshots |
| POST | `/v1/payouts` | `{tenant_id, amount_cents, currency, payee:{party_id_type, party_identifier}, idempotency_key?}` | Mojaloop quote→transfer, then ledger payout (104) |
| POST | `/activities/hold-deposit` | `{tenant_id, booking_id, amount_cents, currency?}` | Temporal `HoldDeposit` activity (SPEC §6) |
| POST | `/activities/void-hold` | `{tenant_id, deposit_id? \| booking_id?}` | Temporal `VoidHold` compensation |

Idempotency: pass `idempotency_key`; without one, ids are derived
deterministically from `booking_id` / `deposit_id` so retries are safe.

## Events & commands

- **Outbox** (SPEC §9): after each ledger op a CloudEvent
  (`com.opendesk.payments.{DepositHeld|DepositCaptured|RefundPosted|NoShowFeePosted|PayoutPosted|PaymentPosted}`)
  is published via Dapr pubsub component `pubsub-kafka` to topic
  `opendesk.payments.events` (`POST {DAPR_HOST}:{DAPR_HTTP_PORT}/v1.0/publish/pubsub-kafka/opendesk.payments.events`).
  Publication is best-effort: failures are logged and counted
  (`events_failed` counter), never rolled back — the ledger is the source of truth.
- **Commands**: consumes `opendesk.payments.commands` (ChargeDeposit, Refund,
  NoShowFee) with idempotent processing (transfer id derived from command id).

## Mojaloop adapter

`src/mojaloop.rs`: FSPIOP-style `POST {MOJALOOP_ENDPOINT}/quotes` then
`POST {MOJALOOP_ENDPOINT}/transfers` (mojaloop-simulator compatible, FSPIOP
headers included). Payout ordering: rail first (deterministic `transferId`
from idempotency key), then ledger transfer; a ledger failure after a
committed rail transfer is logged CRITICAL for operator reconciliation.

## Run

```bash
cargo run                      # dev (sim ledger)
cargo test                     # sim ledger invariant/unit tests
cargo build --features tb-live # live TigerBeetle client
docker build -t opendesk/payments-service .
```

Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM; Kafka consumer drains via a shutdown
watch channel before exit.
