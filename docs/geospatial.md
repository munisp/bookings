# Geospatial: location intelligence, map dashboards and geo-targeted campaigns

Wave 8 (SPEC-W8) adds end-to-end geospatial capability to OpenDesk: contacts
carry locations, demand is aggregated into analytical geo tables in the
lakehouse, operators explore everything on maps, and any audience you can draw
on a map can be activated with a paced omnichannel campaign.

This document covers the architecture, a "getting started" walkthrough, and
concrete geospatial use cases for **every industry pack** in
[`industries/index.json`](../industries/index.json).

## Architecture

The geospatial stack has four layers — operational, analytical, visualization
and activation:

```

```

### Operational geo — PostGIS in booking-service

The booking database runs on `postgis/postgis:16-3.4` with three RLS-scoped
tables (same `withTenant` pattern as every sibling table):

- **`contact_locations`** — one geography(Point, 4326) per
  `(tenant_id, contact_id)`, with a `source` of `booking_address`,
  `channel_share`, `manual` or `geocode`.
- **`service_areas`** — named geography(MultiPolygon, 4326) polygons with a
  `meta` jsonb bag (e.g. delivery zones, coverage territories).
- **`geo_campaigns`** — geo-targeted campaign records: channel, message,
  target geometry, `audience_count` and a
  `draft/running/completed/failed` status lifecycle.

All geom columns carry GiST indexes. The management API (tenant-scoped, same
auth/RLS as existing `/v1` routes):

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PUT /v1/contacts/{id}/location` | Upsert a contact's point (`{lat, lng, source?}`) |
| `GET /v1/locations/summary?from=&to=&offering_id=` | Booking-joined contact points (cap 5000) + server-side `ST_SnapToGrid` clusters when > 500 points |
| `GET/POST/DELETE /v1/service-areas[/{id}]` | Manage service-area polygons (GeoJSON in/out; Polygon promoted to MultiPolygon) |
| `POST /v1/geo/audience/preview` | Count + masked sample of contacts inside a polygon or radius (`ST_Within` / `ST_DWithin`) |
| `POST/GET /v1/geo/campaigns[/{id}]` | Launch and monitor geo-targeted campaigns |

Optional geocoding: when `GEOCODE_ENABLED=true`, a booking that carries an
address string is geocoded via Nominatim (1 req/s, descriptive User-Agent, 5s
timeout, cached by address hash) and stored as a contact location with
`source=geocode`. Off by default.

### Analytical geo — Apache Sedona in the lakehouse

The Spark job `infra/lakehouse/spark/jobs/geo_analytics.py` (Sedona context
from `jobs/sedona_common.py`) reads silver bookings plus contact-location
extracts and produces three Iceberg gold tables, Trino-visible like the rest
of gold:

- **`gold.geo_demand_h3`** — bookings per H3 resolution-8 cell per tenant per
  day, with cell geometry. The cell-level demand heatmap; the base layer for
  hotspot and site-selection analysis.
- **`gold.geo_service_area_coverage`** — bookings inside vs outside each
  service area (`ST_Within` join against a service-areas extract). Measures
  whether operations match declared territories.
- **`gold.geo_hourly_density`** — demand heat cells by hour-of-week. Drives
  staffing and shift planning.

dbt gold models + docs follow the existing `infra/lakehouse/dbt` patterns.

### Visualization — MapLibre + GeoLibre

- **Admin dashboards (MapLibre GL):** the admin-web **Locations** page renders
  `/v1/locations/summary` points/clusters on an OSM basemap with date-range
  and offering filters, plus a toggleable service-area layer and
  draw-to-create polygons (`@maplibre/maplibre-gl-draw`). The **Geo-campaigns**
  page (owner/admin) lets you draw a circle or polygon, preview the audience
  live, compose a message and launch.
- **GeoLibre workbench:** `ghcr.io/opengeos/geolibre` is exposed at `/gis/*`
  via APISIX (JWT-protected) for free-form GIS exploration, and the
  `geolibre` Jupyter package
  (`infra/lakehouse/notebooks/geolibre-exploration.ipynb`) renders
  `gold.geo_demand_h3` and service areas in an analyst notebook
  (`Map(center=...)`, `add_geojson(...)`). See
  [docs/geospatial-infra.md](geospatial-infra.md) for Sedona setup, the gold
  table reference and the Trino geo query cookbook.

### Activation — geo-targeted campaigns

`POST /v1/geo/campaigns` accepts a name, channel, message (with `{name}`
personalization token) and a target (polygon GeoJSON or center + radius). It
creates a running `geo_campaigns` row and starts a Temporal
**`GeoCampaignWorkflow`** (task queue `opendesk-main`) that batches the
audience (`GEO_CAMPAIGN_BATCH`, default 50), sends through the existing paced
notification path (`NotifyPaced`, paced kind `geo_campaign`) over the tenant's
configured channels — WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS — with heartbeats and idempotent
replay (contacts already sent for a campaign id are skipped). Every recipient
emits a **`geo_campaign_message`** usage event (value=1) on
`opendesk.usage.events` via the UsageExtra outbox, so geo campaigns are
metered and billed like any other omnichannel send.

## Getting started

1. **Start the stack.** The booking database now runs PostGIS
   (`postgis/postgis:16-3.4`) and the migration creates
   `contact_locations`, `service_areas` and `geo_campaigns` automatically.
2. **(Optional) Enable geocoding.** Set `GEOCODE_ENABLED=true` on
   booking-service (and optionally override `GEOCODE_BASE_URL`, default
   `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org`). New bookings with an address
   string will backfill contact locations with `source=geocode`.
3. **Seed demo data.** After `scripts/seed-industries.sh`, run:

   ```bash
   scripts/seed-geo.sh
   ```

   This creates two demo service areas (Lagos Island and London Zones 1–2)
   and ~50 synthetic contact locations around Lagos (6.5244, 3.3792) and
   London (51.5074, -0.1278). See the script header for env overrides.
4. **Open the maps.** In the admin dashboard, open **Locations** to see
   demand points/clusters and service areas, and **Geo campaigns** to draw an
   audience and launch a campaign. For free-form GIS work, open **`/gis/`**
   (GeoLibre workbench) or the
   `infra/lakehouse/notebooks/geolibre-exploration.ipynb` notebook to explore
   the `gold.geo_*` tables.
5. **Query the gold tables.** Via Trino:
   `SELECT * FROM gold.geo_demand_h3 WHERE tenant_id = ... ORDER BY day DESC`.

## Use cases by industry pack

Each section below lists concrete geospatial analytics use cases for one pack
in `industries/index.json`, the exact feature that powers it
(`gold.geo_demand_h3`, `gold.geo_service_area_coverage`,
`gold.geo_hourly_density`, `POST /v1/geo/audience/preview`, geo campaigns, or
service-area coverage), and a realistic example.

### salon

Terminology: services, stylists, appointments, clients.

- **Neighbourhood demand heatmap for a second chair or branch** — powered by
  `gold.geo_demand_h3`. Example: appointment cells cluster in two
  neighbourhoods 4 km apart, justifying a Saturday pop-up chair in the
  underserved one.
- **Catchment-based rebooking campaigns** — powered by geo campaigns
  (`POST /v1/geo/campaigns`). Example: draw a 2 km radius around the salon
  and send "this week only" colour-slot offers to clients who live nearby.
- **Stylist shift planning from demand by hour** — powered by
  `gold.geo_hourly_density`. Example: Friday-evening cells near the business
  district peak at 17:00–19:00, so the salon rosters an extra stylist for
  that window.

### clinic

Terminology: treatments, practitioners, visits, patients.

- **Outreach-clinic site selection** — powered by `gold.geo_demand_h3`.
  Example: physiotherapy visit demand concentrates in an eastern suburb with
  no branch, so the clinic pilots a weekly outreach session there.
- **Home-visit catchment definition** — powered by service-area coverage
  (`POST /v1/service-areas` + `gold.geo_service_area_coverage`). Example:
  define a 5 km home-visit polygon and track what share of visits fall
  outside it before widening the catchment.
- **Vaccination-drive targeting** — powered by `POST /v1/geo/audience/preview`
  + geo campaigns. Example: preview patients within 3 km of the clinic, then
  send flu-shot reminders to that audience with `{name}` personalization.

### consultancy

Terminology: engagements, consultants, sessions, prospects.

- **Workshop venue planning from prospect clusters** — powered by
  `GET /v1/locations/summary` clusters. Example: discovery-call prospects
  cluster in two cities, so the next half-day workshop is booked near the
  denser cluster.
- **On-site engagement travel zones** — powered by service-area coverage.
  Example: draw a "no-travel-fee" polygon and flag sessions outside it for a
  travel surcharge using `gold.geo_service_area_coverage`.
- **Local networking event invites** — powered by geo campaigns. Example:
  preview prospects within 25 km of a conference venue and send a paced
  invite sequence ahead of the event.

### support-desk

Terminology: support slots, agents, tickets, customers.

- **On-site troubleshooting dispatch zones** — powered by service-area
  coverage. Example: split the metro into north/south service areas and
  measure ticket coverage per zone in `gold.geo_service_area_coverage` to
  balance field agents.
- **Regional outage blast-radius messaging** — powered by
  `POST /v1/geo/audience/preview` + geo campaigns. Example: when an outage
  hits one district, preview affected customers by polygon and proactively
  send "we're on it" updates before tickets spike.
- **Follow-the-sun staffing** — powered by `gold.geo_hourly_density`.
  Example: ticket heat by hour-of-week shows a Sunday-evening peak from one
  region, so a weekend agent shift is added.

### nigeria-sme

Terminology: services, staff, appointments, customers (Lagos market, NGN).

- **Callout-zone pricing for generator repair** — powered by service-area
  coverage. Example: define Lagos Mainland and Island service areas; jobs
  outside either polygon get a callout fee, tracked via
  `gold.geo_service_area_coverage`.
- **Market-day demand hotspots** — powered by `gold.geo_demand_h3`. Example:
  braiding and tailoring bookings spike in cells around Balogun market on
  Saturdays, so a mobile stylist is scheduled there.
- **Payday promo targeting** — powered by geo campaigns. Example: send
  end-of-month haircut offers via SMS/WhatsApp to customers within 3 km of
  the shop.

### banking

Terminology: services, relationship managers, appointments, customers.

- **Branch/ATM network gap analysis** — powered by `gold.geo_demand_h3`.
  Example: loan-consultation appointment demand clusters in a district with
  no branch, feeding the business case for a new micro-branch.
- **Relationship-manager territory coverage** — powered by service-area
  coverage. Example: assign each RM a polygon territory and audit
  appointments inside vs outside via `gold.geo_service_area_coverage`.
- **BVN/NIN enrollment drives near branches** — powered by geo campaigns.
  Example: target customers within 2 km of a branch with reminders to book a
  BVN/NIN update appointment before the compliance deadline.

### insurance

- **Claim-assessment visit routing** — powered by `GET /v1/locations/summary`
  + `gold.geo_hourly_density`. Example: cluster claim-assessment visits by
  cell and hour so assessors run dense morning routes instead of
  crisscrossing the city.
- **Underwriting territory performance** — powered by
  `gold.geo_service_area_coverage`. Example: compare new-policy consultations
  inside vs outside each agent's declared territory to rebalance assignments.
- **Weather-event proactive outreach** — powered by geo campaigns. Example:
  ahead of forecast flooding, draw the flood-risk polygon and send
  claim-process and prevention guidance to policyholders inside it.

  most riders start in three hotel districts, so pickup points are fixed
  there.
- **Tour departure catchments** — powered by service-area coverage. Example:
  define hotel-corridor polygons and measure city-tour bookings per corridor
  to decide where free pickup applies.
- **Last-minute seat fill** — powered by `POST /v1/geo/audience/preview` +
  geo campaigns. Example: preview contacts within 10 km of a departure point
  and send same-day discount offers for unfilled city-tour seats.

### ecommerce

- **Delivery-slot demand heatmapping** — powered by `gold.geo_demand_h3`.
  Example: delivery-slot bookings concentrate in evening cells on the
  mainland, so an evening dispatch wave is added there.
- **Delivery-zone boundary management** — powered by service-area coverage
  (`POST /v1/service-areas` + `gold.geo_service_area_coverage`). Example:
  orders just outside the free-delivery polygon keep failing; the zone is
  redrawn using the coverage data.

  Example: invite families within 8 km to an open day with a paced WhatsApp
  sequence and track the audience count live.
- **Bus-route coverage vs demand** — powered by service-area coverage.
  Example: overlay current bus-route polygons on
  `gold.geo_service_area_coverage` to spot student clusters outside every
  route.

### agriculture

- **Farm-visit route planning for extension officers** — powered by
  `GET /v1/locations/summary` + `gold.geo_demand_h3`. Example: agronomy
  consultations cluster along one river valley, so farm visits are batched

  suspicious-activity reports per cell and hour-of-week set patrol-shift
  routes and timings.
- **Watch-zone membership coverage** — powered by service-area coverage.
  Example: signups inside vs outside each street polygon show zones lacking
  coordinators, prompting recruitment drives.
- **Rapid local alerts** — powered by geo campaigns. Example: after a
  break-in cluster, send a paced alert and meeting invite to residents
  within the affected blocks.

### civic-services

Terminology: report types, inspectors, inspection slots, residents.

- **Pothole cluster heat → crew dispatch priority** — powered by
  `gold.geo_demand_h3`. Example: pothole-report cells are ranked by density,
  and road crews are dispatched to the hottest cells first; a geo campaign
  then notifies affected residents of the repair window.
- **Missed-collection route auditing** — powered by
  `gold.geo_service_area_coverage`. Example: waste reports inside vs outside
  each collection-round polygon expose a systematically missed street.
- **Service-disruption notifications by ward** — powered by geo campaigns.
  Example: ahead of planned water-main work, notify residents inside the
  affected ward polygon with timings and a status-call booking link.

## Notes

- All audience previews return masked samples only (`phone_masked`); campaign
  sends go through the same consent-aware paced notification path as every
  other channel send.
- Contact locations are tenant-scoped and RLS-protected; erasing a contact
  via the GDPR endpoints removes its location row.
- Every geo-campaign recipient is metered as a `geo_campaign_message` usage
  event, so per-vertical usage shows up in the standard billing pipeline.
